# Personal-Portfolio

This is my third project site and the most complete of the three so far. Since it is my personalized portfolio, it contains a link to the other two project sites I have created in addition to the practice files I have done using Bootstrap, W3CSS, JSON and JavaScript. It also is the most unique layout of the three sites I have with this one utilizing cards to set up the layout. 

In addition, it also contains three separate stylesheets, one for CSS, one for Bootstrap 4 and one for W3CSS. The CSS is used to style background color and the header and footer. The W3CSS is used to create the cards and style their color and shadow size. The Bootstrap is used to style the margin of the cards, the margin of the images and it utilizes Bootstrap's grid system.

Currently this is my most up to date website, having been created during mid-September and there is room for expansion if I do end up creating another project site or some more work in one of my practice folders so I do plan to grow this site as my experience and knowledge grows with it.
